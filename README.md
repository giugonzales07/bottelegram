## Installation

1. Clone the code
   - Clone it to your workspace and upload it to your github, because in this version you need to make changes to code (changes to the API Key, on the date you want to count)
2. Create a bot with BotFather (Access through [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
   - Start the BotFather (/start)

3. Get the API Key and put in your code
   ```Python
    CHAVE_API = "your-key-api"
   ```
4. In BotFather, create the commands ("start" and "contagem")
   - Select the created bot (/mybots)
   - Select "Edit Commands" and follow the instructions
6. Finally, deploy your project to production. For example, you can use Railway to host your bot and keep it running online

## Usage

To use it, simply add the bot to a group, type /start, and then /contagem in the telegram chat
